YOLO Algorithm Basic For Object Detection

Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. 
Object detection has applications in many areas of computer vision, including image retrieval and video surveillance.

There are two types of approach -
1. Non Neural approach
2. Neural approach

We will be dealing with the Neural Network approach.

Object detection can be done by any of the Neural approached listed below :

1. Region Proposals (R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, cascade R-CNN)
2. Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) 
3. You Only Look Once (YOLO) 
4. Single-Shot Refinement Neural Network for Object Detection (RefineDet)
5. Retina-Net 
6. Deformable convolutional network

YOLO - (You Only Look Once)
YOLO is a deep learning algorithm which came out in May 2016 and it became popular because it is fast compared to the other deep learning algorithms like R-CNN, Fast R-CNN , Faster R-CNN. There are many versions of YOLO algorithms. I am making use of Version 3 v3 for convinience. 

With YOLO we can detect objects at relatively high speed. With a GPU we would be able to process over 45 frames/second while with a CPU around 1 frame per second.
